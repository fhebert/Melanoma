The dataset used is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nroman/melanoma-external-malignant-256\nThis dataset contains almost 40,000 images (256 x 256 pixels) of melanoma and harmless skin marks.\n\nThe main objective of this notebook is to provide a way to build an algorithm to recognize melanoma on photographs. For this purpose, I choose to use transfer learning, which consists in using a pre-trained algorithm, adapting a bit its structure for the data and fine-tuning it using a training dataset. The main advantage of this method is that it enables to use an already proven algorithm, which has been trained for a very long time and which has already learned to recognize multiple image patterns in a very large dataset. \n\nIn the following, the ResNext50 model is used (https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnext/). This CNN is namely more efficient than numerous pre-trained alternatives available for transfer learning, and was shown to be among the most accurate ones on the famous ImageNet dataset.\n\nRunning this notebook on Kaggle allows to use a GPU, which is very useful to speed up the CNN work. We will have to indicate to PyTorch which objects should be transferred to the GPU (mainly the model and the image and target values tensors). Thus, each time the .cuda() function appears in the notebook, it means the object to which it is applied is transferred to the GPU.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data importation and processing\n\nWe first import the main libraries needed in the following.

This class takes the following arguments:\n- path: path to the folder containing the data\n- mode: \"train\", \"val\" or \"test\", depending on the dataset we want to build\n- frac_val: fraction of the whole dataset which should be kept for validation\n- frac_test: fraction of the whole dataset which should be kept for evaluation\n- random_state: seed to fix the train / val / test splitting of the dataset and to obtain reproducible results.\n\nAs any subclass of the Dataset class, this class must implement three methods: init, len and getitem. The init method only aims at initializing an instance of the class. The len method returns the number of instances in the dataset. Finally, the getitem method takes as argument an index and returns the corresponding element (both the image and the target value) of the dataset.\nNote that the result given by these two methods depends on the mode initially selected when creating the class instance. If the value of mode is \"train\" (resp. \"val\", \"test\"), then the result of len is the number of instances in the training (resp. validation, evaluation) dataset. Similarly, the getitem method returns the element at position id in the training, validation or evaluation dataset.\n\nAnother method called train_val_test_split is implemented. This simply aims at splitting the dataset in three independent parts: one for training, one for validation, one for evaluation.\n\nNote that the images are preprocessed; they are namely cropped to a square of size 224 x 224 and normalized using mean [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviation [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].
